## 🎓 Lab 1: Understanding Consumer Lag

### Key Concepts

**Consumer Lag:** The difference between what's been produced and what's been consumed
- **Formula:** `LAG = LOG-END-OFFSET - CURRENT-OFFSET`
- **Healthy:** Lag < 1 second for real-time systems
- **Warning:** Lag growing consistently
- **Critical:** Lag > 30 seconds or continuing to grow

**Why Lag Matters:**
- **Walmart Example:** 30-second inventory lag = customers buy unavailable items
- **Uber Example:** Surge pricing lag = wrong prices shown
- **Netflix Example:** Recommendation lag = stale suggestions

**Key Insight:** Consumer lag is the **#1 indicator** of system health in streaming architectures.

---

### Exercise 1.1: Create a Topic with Lag

**Task:** Set up a realistic scenario where consumers fall behind.

```bash
# Create topic
kafka-topics --create \
  --topic order-events \
  --partitions 12 \
  --replication-factor 3 \
  --config min.insync.replicas=2

# Produce 5,000 messages quickly
for i in {1..5000}; do 
  echo "order-$i"
done | kafka-console-producer --topic order-events

# Start ONE slow consumer (will fall behind)
kafka-console-consumer \
  --topic order-events \
  --group order-processor \
  --from-beginning &

# Get the process ID
CONSUMER_PID=$!

# Keep producing to build lag
for i in {5001..10000}; do 
  echo "order-$i"
  sleep 0.05  # Produce faster than consumer can keep up
done | kafka-console-producer --topic order-events &
```

---

### Exercise 1.2: Monitor Consumer Lag

**Task:** Check the lag that's building up.

```bash
# Wait 5 seconds for lag to build
sleep 5

# Check consumer group status
kafka-consumer-groups --describe --group order-processor
```

**Expected Output:**
```
GROUP           TOPIC         PARTITION  CURRENT-OFFSET  LOG-END-OFFSET  LAG
order-processor order-events  0          423             658             235
order-processor order-events  1          401             612             211
order-processor order-events  2          389             645             256
...
```

**Questions to Answer:**
1. What is the total lag across all partitions?
2. Is the lag the same for every partition? Why or why not?
3. How many consumers are in the group?

---

### Exercise 1.3: Calculate Total Lag

**Task:** Use command-line tools to sum lag across all partitions.

```bash
# Calculate total lag
kafka-consumer-groups --describe --group order-processor | \
  awk 'NR>1 {sum+=$5} END {print "Total Lag:", sum, "messages"}'
```

**Now check again 10 seconds later:**
```bash
sleep 10
kafka-consumer-groups --describe --group order-processor | \
  awk 'NR>1 {sum+=$5} END {print "Total Lag:", sum, "messages"}'
```

**Questions to Answer:**
1. Did the lag increase or decrease?
2. What does this tell you about the consumer's health?
3. At what point would you trigger an alert?

---

### Exercise 1.4: Cleanup

```bash
# Stop the background consumer
kill $CONSUMER_PID 2>/dev/null

# Stop background producer if still running
pkill -f kafka-console-producer
```

---

### 💡 Key Takeaway

**Consumer lag thresholds:**
- **< 1 sec:** Healthy real-time system
- **1-5 sec:** Acceptable for analytics
- **5-30 sec:** Warning - investigate
- **> 30 sec or growing:** Critical - scale immediately

---

## 🎓 Lab 2: Consumer Group Sizing and Parallelism

### Key Concepts

**The Partition-Consumer Rule:**
- Each partition can be consumed by **exactly ONE** consumer in a group
- Maximum parallelism = number of partitions
- Undersized group → consumers overloaded, lag builds
- Oversized group → idle consumers, wasted resources
- Perfect size = **one consumer per partition**

**Sizing Formula:**
```
Message Rate: 800 msg/sec
Consumer Capacity: 80 msg/sec per consumer
Minimum Consumers: 800 ÷ 80 = 10 consumers
Optimal Consumers: Number of partitions (if ≥ 10)
```

**Key Insight:** You can't have more **active** consumers than partitions.

---

### Exercise 2.1: Create Undersized Consumer Group

**Task:** Demonstrate what happens when you have too few consumers.

```bash
# Create topic with 12 partitions
kafka-topics --create \
  --topic inventory-updates \
  --partitions 12 \
  --replication-factor 3

# Produce test data
for i in {1..10000}; do echo "inventory-$i"; done | \
  kafka-console-producer --topic inventory-updates

# Start only 2 consumers (undersized for 12 partitions)
kafka-console-consumer \
  --topic inventory-updates \
  --group inventory-sync \
  --from-beginning > /dev/null 2>&1 &

kafka-console-consumer \
  --topic inventory-updates \
  --group inventory-sync \
  --from-beginning > /dev/null 2>&1 &

# Wait for rebalance
sleep 5

# Check member assignment
kafka-consumer-groups --describe \
  --group inventory-sync \
  --members --verbose
```

**Expected Output:**
```
GROUP           CONSUMER-ID        HOST        #PARTITIONS
inventory-sync  consumer-1-xxx     /172.x.x.x  6
inventory-sync  consumer-2-xxx     /172.x.x.x  6
```

**Questions to Answer:**
1. How many partitions is each consumer handling?
2. Is this balanced? What's the problem?
3. If each consumer can handle 100 msg/sec and you're getting 800 msg/sec, what happens?

---

### Exercise 2.2: Calculate Optimal Group Size

**Scenario:** Your topic has these characteristics:
- 12 partitions
- 800 messages/sec inbound rate
- Each consumer can process 80 messages/sec

**Your Task:** Calculate the optimal consumer group size.

```
Step 1: Minimum consumers needed for throughput
        = 800 msg/sec ÷ 80 msg/sec per consumer
        = ___ consumers

Step 2: Maximum consumers possible
        = Number of partitions
        = ___ consumers

Step 3: Optimal size
        = min(capacity needed, partitions available)
        = ___ consumers

Answer: You need ___ consumers for optimal performance.
```

---

### Exercise 2.3: Observe Oversized Consumer Group

**Task:** See what happens with too many consumers.

```bash
# Stop previous consumers
pkill -f kafka-console-consumer

# Delete consumer group to start fresh
kafka-consumer-groups --delete --group test-oversized 2>/dev/null || true
sleep 2

# Start 20 consumers for a 12-partition topic
for i in {1..20}; do
  kafka-console-consumer \
    --topic inventory-updates \
    --group test-oversized \
    --from-beginning > /dev/null 2>&1 &
done

# Wait for rebalance
sleep 10

# Check assignment
kafka-consumer-groups --describe \
  --group test-oversized \
  --members | head -25
```

**Expected Output:**
```
GROUP           CONSUMER-ID        #PARTITIONS
test-oversized  consumer-1-xxx     1
test-oversized  consumer-2-xxx     1
...
test-oversized  consumer-12-xxx    1
test-oversized  consumer-13-xxx    0  ← IDLE
test-oversized  consumer-14-xxx    0  ← IDLE
...
test-oversized  consumer-20-xxx    0  ← IDLE
```

**Questions to Answer:**
1. How many consumers are actively consuming?
2. How many consumers are idle?
3. What's the waste in running 20 consumers for 12 partitions?

---

### Exercise 2.4: Cleanup

```bash
# Stop all consumers
pkill -f kafka-console-consumer

# Delete consumer groups
kafka-consumer-groups --delete --group inventory-sync 2>/dev/null || true
kafka-consumer-groups --delete --group test-oversized 2>/dev/null || true
```

---

### 💡 Key Takeaway

**Consumer Group Sizing Rules:**
- **Undersized:** Lag builds, system falls behind
- **Perfect size:** One consumer per partition
- **Oversized:** Wasted resources, some consumers idle
- **Rule of thumb:** Start with partition count, scale up partitions if needed

---

## 🎓 Lab 3: Broker Health Monitoring

### Key Concepts

**Critical Broker Metrics:**

1. **Under-Replicated Partitions**
   - Alert: Any value > 0 for more than 5 minutes
   - Means: Some partitions don't have full replicas in sync
   - Risk: If another broker fails, data loss possible

2. **Disk Usage**
   - Warning: > 75%
   - Critical: > 85%
   - Action: Add disk space or reduce retention

3. **CPU Usage**
   - Warning: > 75% sustained
   - Critical: > 90%
   - Action: Scale horizontally or tune configs

4. **Request Queue Size**
   - Warning: > 100 requests queued
   - Means: Brokers can't keep up with requests
   - Action: Increase network threads or add brokers

**Key Insight:** Under-replicated partitions is the **most critical** metric - indicates imminent data loss risk.

---

### Exercise 3.1: Monitor Healthy Cluster

**Task:** Check your cluster's baseline health.

```bash
# Check for under-replicated partitions
kafka-topics --describe --under-replicated-partitions
```

**Expected Output:** (empty if healthy)

If you see output, something is wrong! All partitions should be fully replicated.

```bash
# List all topics and check their health
kafka-topics --list | while read topic; do
  echo "=== $topic ==="
  kafka-topics --describe --topic $topic | grep -E "Leader|Isr"
done
```

**Questions to Answer:**
1. Do all partitions have the expected number of replicas?
2. Are all replicas in the ISR list?
3. Are leaders evenly distributed across brokers?

---

### Exercise 3.2: Simulate Broker Failure

**Task:** See how the cluster responds to a broker failure.

```bash
# First, create a test topic
kafka-topics --create \
  --topic health-test \
  --partitions 9 \
  --replication-factor 3

# Produce some test data
for i in {1..1000}; do echo "message-$i"; done | \
  kafka-console-producer --topic health-test

# Check initial state
echo "=== Before Failure ==="
kafka-topics --describe --topic health-test

# Stop broker-2
docker stop broker-2

# Wait for cluster to detect failure
echo "Waiting 10 seconds for cluster to detect failure..."
sleep 10

# Check for under-replicated partitions
echo "=== After Failure ==="
kafka-topics --describe --under-replicated-partitions
```

**Expected Output:**
You should see partitions that had Broker 2 as a replica showing as under-replicated.

**Questions to Answer:**
1. How many partitions are under-replicated?
2. Can you still produce/consume messages?
3. What's the risk if another broker fails now?

---

### Exercise 3.3: Observe Self-Healing

**Task:** Watch the cluster automatically recover.

```bash
# Restart broker-2
docker start broker-2

# Wait for it to rejoin
echo "Waiting for broker-2 to rejoin cluster..."
sleep 15

# Check if under-replicated partitions are gone
echo "=== After Recovery ==="
kafka-topics --describe --under-replicated-partitions

# Should be empty again - cluster self-healed!

# Verify all partitions are healthy
kafka-topics --describe --topic health-test | grep -E "Partition|Isr"
```

**Questions to Answer:**
1. How long did self-healing take?
2. Are all partitions back in sync?
3. Did you lose any data during the failure?

---

### Exercise 3.4: Set Up Monitoring Alerts

**Task:** Define alert thresholds for your system.

Create a file called `kafka-alerts.yml`:

```yaml
# Prometheus Alert Rules for Kafka Monitoring

groups:
  - name: kafka_alerts
    interval: 30s
    rules:
    
      # Critical: Under-Replicated Partitions
      - alert: KafkaUnderReplicatedPartitions
        expr: kafka_server_replicamanager_underreplicatedpartitions > 0
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Kafka has {{ $value }} under-replicated partitions"
          description: "Some partitions don't have full replicas. Risk of data loss if another broker fails."
          
      # Warning: High Disk Usage
      - alert: KafkaDiskUsageHigh
        expr: (kafka_log_size_bytes / kafka_disk_total_bytes) > 0.75
        for: 10m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Kafka disk usage is {{ $value | humanizePercentage }}"
          description: "Consider increasing retention cleanup frequency or adding more disk space."
          
      # Critical: Very High Disk Usage
      - alert: KafkaDiskUsageCritical
        expr: (kafka_log_size_bytes / kafka_disk_total_bytes) > 0.85
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Kafka disk usage is {{ $value | humanizePercentage }}"
          description: "Urgent: Add disk space or reduce retention immediately."
          
      # Warning: High Consumer Lag
      - alert: KafkaConsumerLagHigh
        expr: kafka_consumer_lag > 5000
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Consumer group {{ $labels.group }} has lag of {{ $value }} messages"
          description: "Consumer is falling behind. Consider scaling the consumer group."
          
      # Critical: CPU Usage High
      - alert: KafkaBrokerCPUHigh
        expr: kafka_broker_cpu_usage > 0.75
        for: 10m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Broker {{ $labels.broker }} CPU at {{ $value | humanizePercentage }}"
          description: "Consider horizontal scaling or config tuning."
```

**Questions to Answer:**
1. What's your threshold for alerting on consumer lag?
2. How long should you wait before alerting on under-replicated partitions?
3. What's the difference between a "warning" and "critical" alert?

---

### 💡 Key Takeaway

**Monitoring Priority:**
1. **Under-replicated partitions:** Most critical - data loss risk
2. **Consumer lag:** Application health indicator
3. **Disk usage:** Operational sustainability
4. **CPU/Memory:** Capacity planning
